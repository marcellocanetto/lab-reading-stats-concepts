Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?

There's no difference. They are two names for the same thing. They tend to be used in different contexts, though. You talk about the expected value of a random variable and the mean of a sample, population or probability distribution.

Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?

Quoting the article "The Problem with P-Values" (https://towardsdatascience.com/the-problem-with-p-values-f056245f78a3), P-values is a reliable tool to understand the significance of our evidence but relying too much, or even only, on a single metric to support broader hypothesis is dangerous. Users of such research must keep a broader perspective.

Challenge 3: Applying testing to a specific case: A/B testing.

I cannot open the links of the articles, sorry.
